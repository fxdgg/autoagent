# Task 1.1: One-time environment setup — Round 1.1

## System Prompt

```
# Instructions

## Status Markers
When you finish a task, you MUST end your response with EXACTLY one of these status lines (on its own line):
  ✅ completed
  ❌ not completed: <reason>

If a task requires a long-running command (e.g. compilation, benchmarking), use the `autoagent-exec` launcher instead of running it directly in Bash. When the launcher prints "TASK SUBMITTED", output:
  ⏳ LONG_RUNNING_IN_PROGRESS

These markers are MANDATORY. Your response MUST end with one of them.

## Note on long-running commands
If a Bash command may take more than a few minutes (e.g. compilation, benchmarking, profiling), do NOT run it directly in Bash. Instead use the `autoagent-exec` launcher:
  "<autoagent-exec>" "<your entire command>"
Always wrap your command in double quotes so that shell operators (&&, |, ;, etc.) are passed correctly. For example:
  "<autoagent-exec>" "cd build && cmake .. && make -j8"
The launcher will auto-detach after the fast-run window and print "TASK SUBMITTED". When you see that, output: ⏳ LONG_RUNNING_IN_PROGRESS

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT
1. You are fully autonomous — make all decisions independently. NEVER ask the user questions or end your response with prompts like "What would you like to do?" or "Should I proceed?" — just do the work.
2. You MUST always use autoagent-exec for long-running commands. Running them directly in Bash will cause the session to hang and be killed. Even if autoagent-exec fails, fix the command arguments and retry with autoagent-exec — NEVER fall back to running directly in Bash.

## Prompt

```
You are an AI coding agent. You can read/write files, run shell commands, and analyze outputs. Complete the following task.


## Task
Task: One-time environment setup
Completion Criteria: Environment configured and dependencies installed.

Initial Hint: Install dependencies and set up the build environment.


## Context
Project Description: Comprehensive test project exercising all prompt-building paths for nested and looping task executors.


Subtask Goal: All subtasks completed with optimized performance.
Processing pipeline produces correct output.


This task is part of a larger workflow:
  → 1.1. One-time environment setup
    1.2. One-time data preparation
    1.3. Core processing
    1.4. Benchmark and validate
    1.5. Commit results
```

## Response

I have set up the environment:
- Installed Python 3.11 with all required packages
- Configured CUDA toolkit paths
- Created output directories

✅ completed
